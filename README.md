# Wildcards_C

A program implemented in C that gets input wildcards like * or ? and a string and as a result the output will be the files in the folder that match the input.
For example let the folder contain: page1.html page2.html page3.html files
Then for input page?.html the output will be: page1.html page2.html page3.html

The program uses struct in order to find which part of the input needs to be replaced to match the files.
